"Bacteria are the original gasmen."

In honor of the thousands of little bacteria my throat is currently harboring, this post is about strep.  The most common strain of strep that infects humans is group A streptococcus (abbreviated GAS.  Yep, fucking serendipity)[^1].  You might also hear it called Streptococcus pyogenes (fever-causing), though more than likely if you’re the kind of person reading this blog you will never hear either of these terms, because you don’t go to the doctor like a pussy every time your throat hurts.  So anyways, these little fuckers are generally arranged in chains of spheres, kinda like your girlfriend’s dumb pearl necklace that you have to pretend is pretty (yeah cool bitch, you’re wearing a chain of submarine tonsil stones.  I will never understand the things society chooses to value).  They’re often found on skin and become a problem when they get introduced to the oral cavity.  Obviously, there are a few ways this can happen and some are more honorable than others.
Once inside these guys produce asexually (like the fucking GASmen they are) multiplying hundreds of times while pumping out toxins faster than freshman finance major Katie from Chicago spits out her “birthdate” when the bouncer shows the slightest bit of doubt at her Pokémon-card quality “ID.”  These toxins primarily consist of Streptolysins, which fuck up your red bloods cells and pyogenic exotoxins, which are superantigens that create most of the symptoms we know and love.
Currently, Strep throat is easily treated with an array of antibiotics, though how long this will work for, who fucking knows.  Pharmaceutical companies don’t really research antibiotics anymore because they can’t produce nearly as much profit as things like, say, erectile dysfunction meds.  After all, why look out for the good of humanity when you can jack yourself off to 80% profit margins in between getting in bed with congress?[^2]  The problem is that the second an antibiotic is released, it loses value, as bacteria catch on and wisen up.  Sort of how “Hey I started my own nonprofit in highschool want a drink?” just doesn’t work as well on the senior girls as it does with freshmen.  Furthermore, pharma companies are more into drugs you have to take, and thus pay for, your whole life (i.e. they’re looking for something serious and committed), so they’d rather not focus on the quick fling antibiotics provide.
While this will most likely come back to haunt them when humanity is wiped out and no one is left to buy their medications for chronically watery eyes, mildly high blood pressure, and poor hair growth, it hasn’t yet; so don’t look for them to be changing anytime soon.

[^1]: Maybe not as random a coincidence as you think.  Bacteria are responsible for most anaerobic respiration, making them the original fucking gasmen.  In fact, anything stronger than beer or wine actually kills the bacteria fermenting it, so basically these soldiers, these fucking heroes, are giving their lives for the Gas.  Pour one out for the microbes.
