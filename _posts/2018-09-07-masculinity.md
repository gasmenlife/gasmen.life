title: Top 5 Most Masculine Characters in the History of Western Narrative
---

Prescribed as doctrine:


1. **Mad Max** [(Mad Max: Fury Road)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/)

    If you combine Tom Hardy’s ski-slope traps, less dialogue than a Trump-Clinton dinner date, and possibly the longest fight scenes of film history, you’ll come away with something damn near close to the paragon of masculine virtue. Between the cars, guns, and one-liners, this film is practically dripping from the testosterone that Tom’s tortured hero-of-circumstance character puts out every second the camera rests on him. The common conception that this film is feminist should also be addressed: it is, but that in no way detracts from its masculinity (Charlize Theron was a close runner up to Tom Hardy here).

    Key points:

    * Is in a car practically the whole movie
    * 112 body count
    * Talks about 3 times
    * Is Tom Hardy

2. **Leonidas** [(300)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/)

    One word: fucking yoked. This man doesn’t even need armor, just a washboard set of abs that are always slightly sweaty (or “greeced,” if you will). If there were a 300 video game it would have 3 buttons: 1) yell 2) kill Persians 3) kill fucking Persians. Not only does Gerard Butler and 299 of his closest gasmen defend the greatest nation in history from the largest army the world has ever seen, he, as Kendrick Lamar would say, makes it look sexy. Boy leaves his wife like a goddamn champion because he knows the only woman that matters is mother Greece. Plus he cuts off the Xerxes motherfucker’s soft ass jewelry, and keeps blood out of that beard all movie somehow.

    Key points:

    * Blood
    * More blood
    * Dead barbarians
    * MuScLeS

3. **Tyler Durden** [(Fight Club)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/)

    This one is borderline unfair because he is the literal incarnation of another man’s ideal masculinity. Only reason he isn't ranked hire is that other man happens to be the bitchy narrator (Edward Norton). Man’s about as soft as they come - “what kind of dining set defines me as a person?” Bitch you don’t need a set to dine you just need fucking food. Nonetheless Tyler’s comprehensive knowledge of urban terrorism theory, disregard for personal health and hygiene, and quasi socioanarchist agenda make him 'bout as manly as they come.

    Key points:

    * Chiseled
    * Unclean
    * Masochistic
    * Unrepressed

4. **Batman** [(The Dark Knight)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/)

    If Tyler is the paradigm of proletariat masculinity, Batman epitomizes the manly aristocracy.  He’s rich as fuck, but just uses that to beat the shit out of people that piss him off. Plus the whole tortured-hero-living-up-to-parental-expectations-he-can-never-meet mantra really hits the Y chromosome nail on the head. Enter the Joker, gender-neutral nonconformist with wacky hair and wackier face. Batman just makes that face even wackier and accompanies this with callback one-liners.  Man is in a battle for the soul of Gotham and still has time to think of zingers. His attachment to that dumb bitch Maggie Gyllenhaal keeps him low on the list. That and the cape. Capes are just half dresses.

    Key points:

    * Rich
    * Sick toys
    * Sicker car
    * Bruce Wayne is also a badass

5. **Jaws** [(Jaws)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/)

    I don’t see any need to explain this one. Picks up girls at the beach with ease (practically swimming in it). Eats that pussy like a monster. Is a fucking shark.

    Key points:

    * Is a fucking shark.
