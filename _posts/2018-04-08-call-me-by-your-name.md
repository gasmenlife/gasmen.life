  Some weird sexuality shit steve mused about for a book report since apparently college == third grade + puberty.

In the film [Call Me By Your Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_by_Your_Name_(film)), based on the eponymous book by André Aciman, 
the central focus is an examination of the relationship that develops between 17 year old Elio and 24 year old graduate student, Oliver.  
The two are brought together when Oliver comes to study with Elio’s father, a professor, for six weeks in the family’s summer home.  The book, and derivatively the film, draws its curious title from a seemingly odd pillow talk ritual that Elio and Oliver develop after they sleep together for the first time.  Oliver says to Elio, “Call me by your name, and I’ll call you by mine.”
    Throughout the rest of the story the two protagonists frequently address one another in this manner, often without any following dialogue.  It seems as if they draw satisfaction from the act itself.  The very last lines of the film, which occur after Oliver has left, married, and started a family are Elio addressing Oliver as Elio and Oliver whispering, “Oliver,” in return.
    It is easy to write off these exchanges in a variety of ways.  It could simply be a romantic quirk of their relationship, which like all such quirks cannot fully be understood by an outsider.  It could also tie into their shared homosexuality, as a way of reveling in their uniqueness.  It is difficult, after all, to imagine a similar ritual in a conventional heterosexual relationship as names are inextricably linked with gender, and the misuse of the one implies misperception of the other.  What boy would ever want to called by his girlfriend’s name, or vice versa?  Both of these possibilities are fully possible and likely partially correct, but do not seem to entirely explain the emotional weight the ritual holds for the characters involved.
    At its core, I think the exchange hints at the fundamental nature of human sexuality, that  one is attracted to that which reflects one’s own self value.  As such, humans seek those in whom they see themselves as they truly wish to be.  Sex holds a certain satisfaction beyond the physical because it is an exchange, and thus a confirmation of, value.  Proffering affection, and receiving it in turn, acknowledges the value of the other and confirms your own, in an almost economic fashion.  Thus we seek those whom we most esteem, knowing that such a conquest, if conducted freely, will confirm our own worth.  I believe this is the idea at the heart of Oliver’s request to Elio.  Names are closest thing we have to a semantic symbol of personal worth and value, and by bestowing theirs upon one another they confirm each other’s value as well as their own.  Each of them castes his identity upon the object of his love and thus confirms his own value, and by receiving the identity of the other, he allows him to love himself as well.  Consequently their relationship is a celebration of their own worth as well as the other’s, an acknowledgment of personal value and a willingness to share this value with another.
