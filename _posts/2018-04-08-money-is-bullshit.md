title: Money is Bullshit

<div class="message">
  And acorns are the answer.

People say money makes the world go round, but in reality fucking physics makes the world go round.  Or god.  Or both.  Depends on your stance on these things.  Anyways, back to money: maybe it used to mean something, but ever since we went off the gold standard, money became complete bullshit.  Back in the good old days value was value, it meant something.  Every dollar you had was traced to a product of your efforts, your labor, your talents.  Now money is just another fucking tool of control the government uses to keep people in line, a government that’s just a glorified mafia stealing the products of the laborer in exchange for protection nobody ever asked for.  The only difference between the IRS and a band of robbers is the IRS is better armed.  Taxation is fucking theft.

So anyways, here’s the fucking thing.  The only way we get out from under the yoke of oppression placed on us since birth is create our own system of currency, one consisting of units that are once more tethered to man’s value, and his willingness to exchange that value with others for mutual profit.  Here at Gasmen.life, we believe acorns present the ideal solution.  On a symbolic level the potential found in a single acorn reflects the potential of the dollar, and at a functional level acorns are tangible, well-sized, and aesthetically pleasing.  While some objection could be made to the use of an organic currency and its potential for decay, we consider all those objections fucking worthless.  Another issue may be acorn inflation brought on by people deliberately planting acorn trees.  Easy solution: you see your neighbor planting an acorn tree, burn it the fuck down.  It’s a tree eat tree world out there, and the markets will fucking regulate themselves.  Gasmen out.
